    abstract = "The impressive performance of GPT-3 using natural language prompts and in-context learning has inspired work on better fine-tuning of moderately-sized models under this paradigm. Following this line of work, we present a contrastive learning framework that clusters inputs from the same class for better generality of models trained with only limited examples. Specifically, we propose a supervised contrastive framework that clusters inputs from the same class under different augmented {``}views{''} and repel the ones from different classes. We create different {``}views{''} of an example by appending it with different language prompts and contextual demonstrations. Combining a contrastive loss with the standard masked language modeling (MLM) loss in prompt-based few-shot learners, the experimental results show that our method can improve over the state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of 15 language tasks. Our framework makes minimal assumptions on the task or the base model, and can be applied to many recent methods with little modification.",
