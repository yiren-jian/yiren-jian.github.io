abstract  ="Biological processes such as transcription{,} repair{,} and regulation require the interactions between DNA and proteins. To unravel their functions{,} it is imperative to determine the high-resolution structures of DNA-protein complexes. However{,} experimental methods for this purpose are costly and technically demanding. Consequently{,} there is an urgent need for computational techniques to identify the structures of DNA-protein complexes. Despite technological advancements{,} accurately identifying DNA-protein complexes through computational methods still poses a challenge. Our team has developed a cutting-edge deep-learning approach called DDPScore that assesses DNA-protein complex structures. DDPScore utilizes a 4D convolutional neural network to overcome limited training data. This approach effectively captures local and global features while comprehensively considering the conformational changes arising from the flexibility during the DNA-protein docking process. DDPScore consistently outperformed the available methods in comprehensive DNA-protein complex docking evaluations{,} even for the flexible docking challenges. DDPScore has a wide range of applications in predicting and designing structures of DNA-protein complexes."}
